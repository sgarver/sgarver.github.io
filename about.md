### {{ page.title }}

Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at Strategic Healthcare Programs in Santa Barbara, CA. My role involves designing and integrating React components, data models, interfaces, and more, all aimed at enhancing our web applications and boosting security. I have a solid background in server-side development, particularly with VB/C# .NET, and I’m skilled in writing SQL queries, developing stored procedures, and maintaining Content-Security-Policy headers.

I began my career at Strategic Healthcare Programs in 2011 as a Media Specialist, where I worked on client-side applications and created email newsletters that worked across various clients. I then transitioned into a UX Developer role, where I deepened my expertise in React.js and JavaScript.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about cybersecurity. I hold multiple CompTIA certifications—Pentest+, SySA+, Security+, Network+, and A+—and I actively contribute to open-source projects. One of my projects involves developing tools to identify vulnerabilities, such as the SeleniumGreed exploit.

I’m proficient in a variety of security tools and programming languages, including Wireshark, Nmap, JavaScript, C#, Python, and SQL, and I’m comfortable working across Linux, Windows, and OSX. When I’m not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest in technology and contributing to the cybersecurity community.
